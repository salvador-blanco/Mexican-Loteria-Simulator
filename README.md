## Description

Loteria, often referred to as Mexican Bingo, is a game of chance, filled with colour, tradition, and folklore. The game is deeply rooted in Mexican culture, featuring iconic imagery. Our simulator aims to make it easy and fast to play this beloved game, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, at any time.

Loteria Mexicana is a deterministic game, so why do we even play it? Instead we can get the results instantly.

## How it Works

The simulator randomly draws Loteria cards, checking them against your virtual randomly generated tabla (board). It's a perfect way to familiarize yourself with the symbols and their names or to enjoy a quick game without the need for physical cards.

### Features:

- Instant draw and results
- No need for beans or pebbles
- Familiarize yourself with Loteria cards and their meanings
- Play alone or with friends
- No physical cards needed
